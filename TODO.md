# UI Library

- Design Concept:
    - Designed for professionals and power users using the software everyday.
    - Low padding and margin with a tight-fit.
    - Desktop first but responsive for mobile.
    - Made for developers, looks like IDE components in Visual Studio Code.
- Developer Experience:
    - Similar to regular HTML components.
    - Extendable theming with the developer able to specify additional classes.
    - No CSS required, totally based on Tailwind v4.
